## Project Description
This weather app is a simple web application that allows users to enter a city name and get the current weather conditions for that location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data in real-time and displays the temperature, weather description, weather icon, as well as the minimum and maximum temperatures for the selected city. The app has a clean and user-friendly interface with a search bar and a button to initiate the search. It also has a minimalist design with two animated shapes in the background.
